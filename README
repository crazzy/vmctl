vmctl - VMware ConTroL script - Johan Hedberg, 2012 - https://johan.pp.se

This is a simple script to simplify automatic power management for VMware.
Probably works on both ESX and ESXi, though only tested on ESXi.


Requirements:

	* SSH enabled on VMware server

	* SSH keys setup for noninteractive use
